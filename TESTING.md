# Testing Infrastructure Summary

## Created Test Files

### Core Test Modules
- `test_utils.py` - Tests for utility functions (conversion, dictionary merging, command execution)
- `test_service_location.py` - Tests for ServiceLocation enum and directory mappings
- `test_file_type.py` - Tests for FileType enum, file naming, requirements, and validation
- `test_config_parser.py` - Tests for the custom CaseSensitiveConfigParser
- `test_sections.py` - Tests for all systemd section classes (Unit, Service, Install, etc.)
- `test_service.py` - Comprehensive tests for the main Service class
- `test_file.py` - Tests for the File class and configuration generation
- `test_integration.py` - End-to-end integration tests

### Test Configuration
- `pytest.ini` - Pytest configuration with test discovery and options
- `conftest.py` - Shared test fixtures and utilities
- `requirements-test.txt` - Test dependencies
- `tox.ini` - Multi-environment testing configuration
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hooks for code quality

### Development Tools
- `Makefile` - Development commands for testing, formatting, and building
- `run_tests.py` - Script to run all tests with various options

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### `test.yml` - Comprehensive Test Suite
- Runs on push to main/master/develop branches and PRs
- Tests against Python 3.8-3.12
- Includes linting with flake8
- Generates coverage reports
- Uploads coverage to Codecov

### `quick-test.yml` - Fast Feedback
- Runs on every push and PR
- Quick tests with Python 3.11
- Validates package imports
- Fast feedback for development

### `publish.yml` - Release Automation
- Triggers on version tags (v*)
- Runs full test suite before publishing
- Automatically publishes to PyPI
- Uses trusted publishing with GitHub OIDC

## Test Coverage

Current test coverage: **94%** with **140 tests**

### Coverage by Module:
- `service_config_foundry/__init__.py` - 100%
- `service_config_foundry/service_location.py` - 100%
- `service_config_foundry/sections/*` - 100% (all section modules)
- `service_config_foundry/utils.py` - 94%
- `service_config_foundry/file_type.py` - 95%
- `service_config_foundry/service.py` - 93%
- `service_config_foundry/config_parser.py` - 73%

## Key Features Tested

### Unit Tests
- Function-level testing for all utility functions
- Class initialization and attribute setting
- Enum value validation and methods
- Error handling and edge cases
- Mock testing for system calls and file operations

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end service creation workflows
- File generation and content validation
- Service lifecycle operations (create, update, replace, delete)
- Multi-file service configurations (service + timer + socket)
- Mount and automount configurations

### Mocking Strategy
- System calls (`systemctl`, file operations) are mocked for safety
- File system operations use temporary directories
- subprocess calls are intercepted to prevent actual system changes
- Permission errors and edge cases are simulated

## Usage

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run with coverage
make test-cov

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_service.py -v

# Run with coverage report
pytest tests/ --cov=service_config_foundry --cov-report=html

# Run tests across multiple Python versions
tox
```

## Continuous Integration

The GitHub Actions workflows ensure:
- All tests pass on multiple Python versions
- Code quality standards are maintained
- Package can be built and imported correctly
- Documentation and examples are up to date
- Automated releases to PyPI

This comprehensive testing infrastructure provides confidence in code quality and helps prevent regressions during development.
